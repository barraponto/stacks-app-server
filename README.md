##Introduction
Find My New iPhone allows you to list an iPhone for sale or browse available iPhones for purchase. For sellers it maximizes their profit by selling directly to the consumer with no fees (think Craigslist), but makes listing easier with predefined fields and access to a new audience of iPhone buyers. For buyers it offers the low prices associated with buying directly but with the added convenience of enhanced search capability that benefits from the standardized listing criteria and ability to sort the available iPhones by location.
